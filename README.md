# AHK.ObjectTypeExtensions
Added methods to AutoHotkey v2 (AHK v2) built-in object types.

This repo contains the extensions to the AHK v2 built-in objects I use.

Most of them are not mine, and will be from the libraries of other people.

Why reinvent the wheel right?

A special thanks to [**@GLaser_Made**](https://github.com/LaserMade) for helping me
convert many of the functions into class methods and integrating them.

## People to check out for cool libraries:

* [**@GLaser_Made**](https://github.com/LaserMade)
* [**@GroggyOtter**](https://github.com/GroggyOtter)
* [**@thqby**](https://github.com/thqby)
* [**@Descolada**](https://github.com/Descolada)
* [**@Axlefublr**](https://github.com/Axlefublr) - Note: No longer supported/maintaining AHK scripts.

## Dependencies

The libraries will generally list all of their dependencies at the top by

```
#Include <this-library>
```

All the libraries I use will be in this repository, so you can *technically* use any / all of my / not my libraries
